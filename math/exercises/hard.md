解：A.我们设女生中最矮的身高为x,那么女生最高身高为x十13.2，则男生最
高的身高为x十13.2=x十19，男生最矮的身高为x十3.6，所以我们能够得
到该班学生最矮身高为x,最高身高为x十19，即能够计算出极差为19，A
选项正确。
B.B选项无法决定最大值，所以B选项无法推出身高的极差。

A.45th
B.50th
C.55th
D.60th
E.65th

解：x是其中第73个百分位数，说明数据中有73%的数据比他小，又因为有68

的数据比y小，所以y大概是第65个百分位数。

III.The range of the five numbers is 2 or more.
A I only
B ll only
C lll only
D I and III
E II and III

my:B ans:E 
我直接把3排除了 但是是or 所以3一定对

range>=3 至少 


If x and y are positive integers, and 1 is the greatest common divisor of x and y, what is the greatest common divisor of 2x and 3y?
my:1
ans:cannot be determined

The average (arithmetic mean) of 4 different integers is 75. If the largest integer is 90, what is the least possible value of the smallest integer?

my:30 ans:33 没看到different

不要约分

Sarah invested $38,700 in an account that paid 6.2% annual interest, compounding monthly. She left the money in this account, collecting interest for three full years. Approximately how much interest did she earn in the last month of this period?

my:7888.83 ans239.47问的是最后一个月的
估算，先忽略monthly，按年算，38700*（1+6.2%）^3=46363.7，46353.7*6.2%/12=239.49

按年算利息，实际利息比按年算的要稍微高点，但是偏差不多


How many positive integers less than 10,000 are such that the product of their digits is 210?

210=2*3*7*5 OR 5*6*7 OR 1*5*6*7

A(4,4)+A(4,4)+A(3,3)=54

If (-1/2)N > (-8)，which of the following could be the value of N?

-3
0
3
10
my:10 0 3 10
ans:-10 -7 -3 0 10

需要分为奇偶，正负考虑。比较复杂，考场最快方法为每个选项计算一遍。由选项可知，N 为整数，当 N 为偶数时，左边不等式肯定大于 0，进而大于-8，所以任意取值均可；当 N 为奇数且N 大于 0 时，左边不等式肯定大于等于-1/2，进而大于-8，所以任意取值均可；当 N 为奇数且N 小于 0 时，N需要大于-3, 也就只有-1 可以。综上，N 的取值范围为-1，所有偶数以及正数。

答案也错了
