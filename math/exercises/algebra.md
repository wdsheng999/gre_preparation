3. If $-1<x<y<0$,which of the
following show the expression
xy,x^2y,and xy^2 listed in order
from least to greatest?

x^2y/xy^2=x/y>1, 但由于是负数要颠倒过来；
如，取x=-2/3,y=-1/3,x/y=2, 但x更小

 
6. If a,b,x,and y are positive inte-
gers,and $13^{a}·13^{b}=(13^{x})^{y}=13^{13}$,
what is the average (arithmetic
mean)of a,b,x,and y?

13为质数且只有1 13两个因子

3. $|x+4|^2-10|x+4|=24$
what is the sum of all possible solutions of the equation?

ans:$y=|x+4|$ y>0
y=12

不等式运算的法则
若$\frac{a+c}{b+d}>\frac{a}{b}$,则$\frac{c}{d}>\frac{a}{b}$
若$\frac{a+c}{b+d}<\frac{a}{b}$,则$\frac{c}{d}<\frac{a}{b}$

1. The sum of n numbers is greater
than 48.If the average (arithmetic
mean)of the n numbers is 1.2,
what is the least possible value of
n?

解：因为这n个数的平均值为1.2，那么
这n个数的和为1.2n。因为这n个
数的总和超过48，我们可以列出不
等式：1.2m>48,解得n>40。又
因为n肯定是整数，那么n最小可
能等于41。

6. Ifx+y≠0，which of the follow-ing is a solution to the inequality
below?
$\frac{x^2-y^2-1}{x+y}>\frac{-1}{x+y}$
Indicate all such answers.
A.x=3 and y =7
B.x=-3 and y =7
C.x=-11 and y=-9
D.x=-9 and y=-6
E.x=-20andy=-24
F.x=12 and y=9
G.x=-2 and y =16

15.Anne批发的装饰品每一件比Bart多
花150%，Anne零售卖出每件装饰
品的价格比她的批发进价高出15%，
Bart零售卖出每件装饰品的价格比
他的批发进价高出185%。A:Anne
的零售价格，B:Bart的零售价格
解：设Bart的批发进价为x,那么Anne的批发进价为2.5x,Bart的零售价为2.85x,Anne的零售价格2.5x(1+15%)=2.875x>2.85x,所以A>B。
答：A

20. The total amount that Mary paid
for a book was equal to the price
of the book plus a sales tax that
was 4 percent of the price of the
book.Mary paid for the book with
a 10 bill and received the correct
change,which was less than
\$3.00.Which of the following
statements must be true?
Indicate all such statements.
A.The price of the book was less
than\$9.50.
B.The price of the book was
greater than 6.90.
C.The sales tax was less than
$0.45.

解：我们设书本身的价格为x,那么销
售税为4%·x,那么Mary一共付
了1.04x,由题目已知条件可以列出不等式：1021.04x<3,解得x>6.73且x<10,所以销售税在0.2692到0.4之间.
A.由上面的分析看出，书本身
价格不一定小于9.5，比如，当书的价格为$9.51时同样是成立的。A选项错误
B.书本身的价格可以是6.73到10之间的任意一个值。B选项错误。
C.我们已知销售税在0.2692到0.4之间，即小于0.4，所以一定小于0.45。C选项正确。

At a certain company,employees who earn 20.00 per hour will be given an increase of \$1.00 per hour.For each of the other employees,either the employee will be given an increase of 1.00 per hour or the employee will be given a percent increase equal to the percent increase that will be given to the employees who earn 20.00 per hour,whichever results in a larger increase for that employee.Which of the following statements are true?
Indicate all such statements.
A.An employee who earns less than 20.00 per hour will be given a percent increase that is greater than the percent increase that will be given to the employees who earn 20.00 per hour.
B.An employee who earns 22.00 per hour will be given an increase of \$1.10 per hour.
