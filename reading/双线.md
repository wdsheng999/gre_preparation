>For two decades after the Civil War,the political cartoons of Thomas Nast remained the most recognizable visual feature of Harpers Weekly,at the time one of the most widely circulated magazines
in the United States.But despite his considerable fame,his dominance over the pictorial content of a
successful periodical,and his unprecedented salary among American illustrations,Nast often felt
beleaguered and disgruntled at Harpers Weekly.At the end of 1886,after nearly quitting on severa
earlier occasions,he declined to renew his contract with his publishers.Writers on Nast have commonly
blamed his dissatisfaction and waning influence at the firm upon political feuding with the management.
allegedly an increasing conservative group reluctant to tolerate Nast's radical,reformist views.But this
ubiquitous explanation greatly exaggerates any such political rift while ignoring a crucial shift in cultural
attitudes towards heightened civility in mainstream joumalism that did far more to fuel resentments
between the artist and his editorial board.Nast's alienation from his longtime employer stem
from divergent political goals and more from differing approaches to the niceties of political debate, most
notably his failure to adapt his distinctly violent cartoons to standards of decorum embraced publishing house during the 1870s.

my:D

唯一一道功能题 功能题不能只看意思 也不能直接看上下文的关系 主要关注文章的形式符号
直接看意思 很容易自己带入 但是文章作者的想法不一定与你或常识一致

D错在refute 反驳前面的第一句 不可能  虽然是but
C意思和原文一致 很好的支持了第一句话  但本身就是和第二局话承接 这题主要的目的是为了和后面

nb的 但不爽  nb是为了突出不爽

ans:A

这句话的目的不在这句话上 


---

第一句 tn很牛 
第二局 but despite(让步)虽然很牛 但不爽
第三局 不爽达到了高潮 但没有解释 辞职了
此处之前没看到什么关键的东西
第四局 writers on  属于长难句 问题是需要重视吗 
终于找到了重要的东西 开始解释了 凭什么它是解释？
blame upon 怪罪 对这些词要敏感 表明是另一些人的观点--》同时 这个不属于passage或者author的看法

所以需要关注的是upon的后面 
第四局 writers认为不爽的原因是political feuding 但并不是作者的观点，是可被争议的

第五局 开局一个but 由上面的引用观点，这后面大概率是个反驳
到political rift这里都没有什么信息
while ignoring 这后面才是最需要看的观点，是对前面观点反驳的核心--shift in cultural attitudes
是怎样的变化呢？civility 所以可以推出之前不civility

对于journalism的补充从句并不重要，仍然是文化不爽的原因

到此 引用方观点定了，作者观点定了，后面的内容已经基本确定

第六局 stem less from A -->more from B 分别是那两个观点

文章看完 脑子里带上：两个对立的观点
然后看题 一定要有预期的答案，因为题目里的选项都是对作者观点的泛化

### jjpassage1

2. Regarding research on fish,it can be inferred from the passage that
A.research studies of the acquisition of important skills by fish have only recently begun to
document the role of conspecifics in the learning process
B.research on social learning in guppies suggests that guppies differ in important ways from
most other fish in the means by which they learn particular skills
C.research on social learning in fish has generally focused on the acquisition of skills other
than foraging
D.research has established that social learning occurs in some fish species without
investigating the development context in which it occurs.
E.research to investigate social learning has been done more extensively on fish than on
other aquatic animals.

解析：该题只能选项定位。D选项可以定位到文章首句，是其同义改写：Although social learning
(the acquisition of specific behaviors by observing other individuals exhibiting those behaviors)
is well documented among fish,few studies have investigated social learning within a
develop mental context in these taxa.

jjpassage 3

3.Which of the following statements,if true,would most strengthen the authors assertion that
Kennedy's work marks a serious departure from the tradition described in the first paragraph?
A.Kennedy places the action in a real-life setting that is nevertheless unfamiliar to the
average viewer or reader.
B.Kennedy movingly portrays the lives and struggles of prominent African Americans in the
United States.
C.Kennedy uses characters found only in ancient African legends and mythology.
D.Kennedy provides insights into American mimetic tradition and dramatic convention.
E.Kennedy depicts the events in a style reminiscent of a television documentary.

解析：选择最原理现实主义 的C

jjpassage 5

3.According to the author,the theory based on fluctuating resource availability might resolve
"apparently conflicting and ambiguous results"because
A.It explains how a particular circumstance can produce disparate effects.
B.It does not assume that all of the results are instances of the phenomenon that the theory is
intended to explain.
C.It predicts that seemingly minor variations in research methodology can have a dramatic
effect on results.
D.Its account is based on a statistical tendency rather than on the supposition that the results
arise from a causal connection.
E.It indicates why a similar outcome may be preceded by very different circumstances on
different occasions.

3.答案：E
解析：根据高亮关键词定位首段。尽管关键词出现在首段，因二段是对首段理论的详细展开，答案
很可能出现在二段。E选项定位该句Since,原因从句：Inparticular,the theory predicts that there
will be no necessary relationship between the species diversity of a plant community and its
susceptibility to invasion,since near-complete exploitation can each occur in both species-
richand species-poor communities。该句用来否定物种多样性的解释，因为不同的（物种丰富）
情况会有一样的结果：（外来物种）的几乎彻底开发利用。


passage 6

2.In pointing to the apparent temperature change in the high latitudes of Greenland,the
skeptics mentioned in the passage intend to raise as a question whether
A.Greenland is less likely to experience extreme temperature changes than are other areas of
the Arctic.
B.Those more localized temperature drops might indicate an important trend not captured by
the upward trend of average Arctic temperatures.
C.There might be a reversal of the temperature trend in the high latitudes of Greenland.
D.The factors that cause temperature change in the high latitudes of Greenland are different
from those that affect the rest of the Arctic.
E.Greenland has more ice and snow on the ground than do other areas of the Arctic.

2.答案：B
解析：本题实质是问为什么要引入skeptics的观点，由定位句可知，skeptics提出格陵兰岛温度下降
是为了与下文的report形成冲突。B选项those more localized temperature drops对应skeptics观点
中的温度下降，upward trend对应report中的温度上升。
C选项中skeptics和report的内容的确冲突，但是并不能表明格陵兰岛的温度趋势是否逆转。
A、D、E三个选项原文找不到对应。【此题已经收录到官方模考题pp0中，网上还有答案为C的版本
应该是以前校订答案的错误】

E.point out subtle differences among controversial historical reports

1.答案：D my：A
解析：全文首句介绍很多历史学家对CM的传记的观点：关注虔诚性，栖性历史准确性。主旨理解正确。Yt转折
后，是作者对CM传记的正面评价，反驳了对CM的指责。
该题A选项说反驳了一个历史界通行的理论，但文中并设有提到任何理论；B说是一个不同寻常的记
录历史时代的方法，但文中显然也没有提到任何方法；C说总结了关于一个历史人物的研究，但显
然文章并设没有全部在说某一个历史人物的研究工作。文中提到了GovernorJohn Winthrop,目的是
为了说明Mather的critical observations;D说反驳了关于某个传记作家某部作品的一些看法，纵观
全文，作者的确是一直反驳一些历史学家对于Mather的传记的看法，正确；E说指出了矛盾的历史
报告的微妙不同，显然与主题已无关。

2.The author of the passage implies that an argument for the historical accuracy of Mather's
works is most strongly supported by which of the following?
A.surviving documents that corroborate Mather's detailed descriptions of his subjects
B.Mather's firsthand personal acquaintance with those about whom he wrote
C.Mather's frank and straightforward accounts of the lives and times of people about whom
he had conducted extensive research

were a part
E.the quantity and nature of the sources from which Mather obtained his information.

2.答案：E MY:A
解析：问题问的是支特Mather传记的准确性的最有力证据，Yet转折后作者评价说，modern
studies have profited both from the breadth of information that Mather provides .....and from
his critical observations of..后文是对该评价的展开。可知选E最有力，quantity=breadth,
nature=critical observation.

A为什么不对呢 description of his subjects

4.It can be inferred from the passage that many historians believe that Mather's biographies
primarily
A.disclose important historical data from the settlers'private diaries
B.glorify the early colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Colony
C.provide a fuller picture of the multifaceted characters of such historical figures as John Winthrop
D.indicate the salutary effects of the settlers'religious practices on colonial life
E.reveal that the settlers considered their lives to be similar to those of the saints

4.【新增题目】答案：B my:D
解析：根据题干定位到文章第一句，根据endowing their subjects with saintly piety可以选出B选
项。

第一句翻译后可以看出 这里的saintly不是religious  并且后面的陈述中也没有出现关于religious practice 的描述 还是要注意前后逻辑一致

文章大意翻译：
①在许多历史学家的观点中，有一种观点坚持认为，Cotton Mather关于马萨诸塞湾殖民地(1702
年出版)的一些定居者的传记是一种圣训，它以栖性历史准确性为代价，赋予他们的臣民以圣洁的
虔诚。②然而，现代研究既得益于Mather提供的范围广大的信息。例如，他对殖民医学的讨论，也
得益于他对州长John Winthrop等领导人物的批判性观察。③Mather的讽刺幽默表现在他对事件的详
细描述上，比如温思罗普防止偷木头的努力，但这被那些指控Mather表现出极其虞诚的主题的人忽
略了。④这项指控也掩盖了Mather>对定居者物质上的繁荣关注，他不仅仅关注精神上的繁荣。⑤此
外，这种贬义的观点低估了传记作为编年史的价值：Matherl收集了各种已发表和未发表的文献作为
资料来源，他对关键事件的选择显示出对殖民地发展性质的明显的每致感。

passage 9

2.In the context of the passage,the highlighted sentence serves to
A.qualify a point made in the preceding sentence
B.correct an erroneous assumption
C.provide evidence in support of a perception cited in the opening sentence
D.provide a rationale for the view expressed in the following sentence
E.establish the popularity of a point of view

2.为什么不选C 

2.答案：A
解析：高亮的句子为“Breendid acknowledge that a few isolated boycotts may have taken place
in other countries."这一句的上一句是说Breen认为抵制消费活动起源于美国，显然高亮句是B做的
让步。A选项最准确(qualify翻译成限制，限定)。下一句是Mary的完全相反的观点：抵制行为起
源于爱尔兰，D选项不正确，高亮句不是为后句的观点提供合理性。

翻译高句子

③例如，T.H. Breen认为消费者抵制是源自美国的一项杰出发明。④Breen的确承认其他国家也可能发起了一些孤立的抵制活动。

C.提供支持开头句子所引用的观点的证据
我的疑问就在这个opening sentence

passage 10

Which of the following,if true,provides the strongest support for the argument given?
A.The drivers of vehicles behind a gravel truck are more likely to remain close behind the
truck if the trucks cargo box is covered than if it is uncovered.
B.Most trucks that carry gravel already carry tarpaulins that their drivers use to cover the
cargo box when they are carrying sand,which can blow out of the cargo box in significant
quantities.
C.Of all the damage that occurs to vehicles on the highway,debris that flies off trucks is the
cause of only a very small fraction.
D.The proposed law allows open-topped trucks on the highway to have uncovered cargo
boxes whenever their cargo boxes are empty.
E.Because of the great weight of a load of gravel,the driver of a gravel truck is often driving
much more slowly than most of the other vehicles on the road.

1.答案：A
解析：该题要求加强论证。文章结论是：最近的要求运输小石子的卡车加盖帆布的法律不能减少飞
贱石子对后续车辆造成的伤害，理由是，石子从车厢飞溅出来的可能性远远小于从轮胎缝隙飞贱出
来的可能性。
A选项加强作用最强。加盖帆布，后续车辆更可能靠近运输石子的卡车，从而提高受伤害的概率
(虽然盖帆布降低了从车相飞溅石子的机率，但没有降低从轮胎缝隙飞贱的机率)。
B选项说很多司机已经携带帆布，但携带不等于加盖。
C选项考虑的是所有伤害的问题，过于宽泛。
D选项讨论的是空车状态，完全无关。
E选项开得慢不能支持碎石头是来自轮胎缝。

passage 11

2.It can be inferred from the passage that Tompkins would be most likely to agree with which
of the following about the critics mentioned in the passage?

B.They are not as dismissive of Fern as some feminist critics have suggested.
C.They exaggerate the extent to which Fern intended her writing to serve a social purpose.
D.They wrongly assume that sentimental must be a pejorative term.
E.They fail to recognize the role that sentimental rhetoric plays to reader's emotions

my:E ans:D
该题问T最会支持的针对文章中评论者的表述。T的观点立场体现在最后一句：T提出针对感情主义自身的替代解释：可以通过左右读者情感方式服务激进变革目标。DE选项之中。D选项更好。之前评论者有insipid的明显负评价。原文末句T的观点，等于承认之前评论者至少认识到感情主义可以服务于保守主义目标，不能等同于E选项，完全意识不到情感主义的作用。

passage 12

Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies?
A.There is no expense associated with operating an automobile that is higher when the
automobile uses the plant-based fuel than when it uses gasoline.
B.Automobiles that have been operated using the plant-based fuel can no longer be operated
using regular gasoline.
C.The environmental damage attributable to automobiles is due almost entirely to the
production and combustion of fuel automobiles use.
D.The advantages of the plant-based fuel over gasoline will not lead those who switch to the
plant-based fuel to do more driving.
E.Most drivers in Ternland will switch from gasoline to the plant-based fuel.

my:A or E ans:D

解析：题目要求找论证基于的假设。文章理由是：新型植物汽车燃料比传统汽油更高效，环境污染更少，价格也更便宜。结论是：司机转用新型植物汽油的话，能降低每年燃油花费，还能减少环境破坏。注意文章理由到结论的概念跳跃：理由讨论的是单位（例如每升）问题，结论是消耗／排放总量问题。作者忽略了另外的重要变量：驾驶里程的总量问题。D选项指出该被忽略变量不应有不利变化，是文章推理基于的假设。

C.reproductive limitations operating during chick rearing
D.the availability of food for newly hatched chicks
E.the differences between altricial and precocial species

my:B ans:A
