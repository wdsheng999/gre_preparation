>For two decades after the Civil War,the political cartoons of Thomas Nast remained the most recognizable visual feature of Harpers Weekly,at the time one of the most widely circulated magazines
in the United States.But despite his considerable fame,his dominance over the pictorial content of a
successful periodical,and his unprecedented salary among American illustrations,Nast often felt
beleaguered and disgruntled at Harpers Weekly.At the end of 1886,after nearly quitting on severa
earlier occasions,he declined to renew his contract with his publishers.Writers on Nast have commonly
blamed his dissatisfaction and waning influence at the firm upon political feuding with the management.
allegedly an increasing conservative group reluctant to tolerate Nast's radical,reformist views.But this
ubiquitous explanation greatly exaggerates any such political rift while ignoring a crucial shift in cultural
attitudes towards heightened civility in mainstream joumalism that did far more to fuel resentments
between the artist and his editorial board.Nast's alienation from his longtime employer stem
from divergent political goals and more from differing approaches to the niceties of political debate, most
notably his failure to adapt his distinctly violent cartoons to standards of decorum embraced publishing house during the 1870s.

唯一一道功能题 功能题不能只看意思 也不能直接看上下文的关系 主要关注文章的形式符号
直接看意思 很容易自己带入 但是文章作者的想法不一定与你或常识一致

D错在refute 反驳前面的第一句 不可能  虽然是but
C意思和原文一致 很好的支持了第一句话  但本身就是和第二局话承接 这题主要的目的是为了和后面

nb的 但不爽  nb是为了突出不爽

ans:A

这句话的目的不在这句话上 



---

第一句 tn很牛 
第二局 but despite(让步)虽然很牛 但不爽
第三局 不爽达到了高潮 但没有解释 辞职了
此处之前没看到什么关键的东西
第四局 writers on  属于长难句 问题是需要重视吗 
终于找到了重要的东西 开始解释了 凭什么它是解释？
blame upon 怪罪 对这些词要敏感 表明是另一些人的观点--》同时 这个不属于passage或者author的看法

所以需要关注的是upon的后面 
第四局 writers认为不爽的原因是political feuding 但并不是作者的观点，是可被争议的

第五局 开局一个but 由上面的引用观点，这后面大概率是个反驳
到political rift这里都没有什么信息
while ignoring 这后面才是最需要看的观点，是对前面观点反驳的核心--shift in cultural attitudes
是怎样的变化呢？civility 所以可以推出之前不civility

对于journalism的补充从句并不重要，仍然是文化不爽的原因

到此 引用方观点定了，作者观点定了，后面的内容已经基本确定

第六局 stem less from A -->more from B 分别是那两个观点

文章看完 脑子里带上：两个对立的观点
然后看题 一定要有预期的答案，因为题目里的选项都是对作者观点的泛化
