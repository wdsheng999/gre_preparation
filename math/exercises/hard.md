2.n是一个偶数，n被7除的余数是3。A：n被14除的余数，B:10。
解：设n=7k+3，其中k是一个整数。由于n是偶数，所以7k是奇数，所以k
是奇数。所以设k=2m+1,其中m是整数，则n=7(2m+1)+3=14m+
10,所以n被14除的余数是10，即A=B。

ans:A not AB

解：A.我们设女生中最矮的身高为x,那么女生最高身高为x十13.2，则男生最
高的身高为x十13.2=x十19，男生最矮的身高为x十3.6，所以我们能够得
到该班学生最矮身高为x,最高身高为x十19，即能够计算出极差为19，A
选项正确。
B.B选项无法决定最大值，所以B选项无法推出身高的极差。
C.算术平均数也无法决定最大值，所以C选项也无法推出学生身高的极差。
